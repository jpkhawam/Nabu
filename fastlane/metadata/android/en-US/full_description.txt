<i>Nabu</i> is an offline note taking app, aimed to be modern-looking and capable, with a UI inspired by Google Keep's. It is focused on looking as modern as possible, without a trade-off of features. This app is still in pre-release.

This app is in development, and is not feature complete yet. Most notably, the major things missing are the ability to pin notes, adding reminders, and of course the app icon. Contributions are always welcome. This app has a great priority for accessibility before all, so if there is anything lacking on that front please submit an issue.
